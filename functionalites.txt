#NoOps
Benefits
    Reduced operational cost
    BaaS - reduced development cost
    FaaS - scaling costs
    Optimization is the root of some cost savings
    Easier Operational Management
    Scaling benefits of FaaS beyond costs
    Reduced packaging and deployment complexity
    Time to market / experimentation
    ‘Greener’ computing?
Drawbacks
    Inherent Drawbacks
        Vendor control(Not in our case)
        Multitenancy Problems(Again not in our case)
        Vendor lock-in(Switching vendors is alos not a problem in our case)
        Repetition of logic across client platforms
        Loss of Server optimizations
    Implementation Drawbacks
        Configuration
        DoS yourself
        Execution Duration
        Startup Latency
        Testing
        Deployment / packaging / versioning
        Discovery
        Monitoring / Debugging
        API Gateway definition, and over-ambitious API Gateways
        Deferring of operations
Mitigating the Drawbacks
    Tooling
    State Management
    Platform Improvements
    Education
    Increased transparency / clearer expectations from Vendors
    The emergence of patterns
    Beyond ‘FaaSification’
    Testing
    Portable implementations
    Abstractions over Vendor implementations
    Deployable implementations
